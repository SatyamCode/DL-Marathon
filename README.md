# DL week (A week full of Deep Learning Madness)

Hey everyone, we bring you "DL week" where we deep dive into various subtopics of deep learning like computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, etc. For each of these topics, we will pick a few relevant problems and help you understand them in detail. Further, we will be implementing each model during a live code-along to help strengthen your understanding. We hope to help you explore a wide spectrum of models and methods. 

## Contents

- Introduction and Recap
  - python introduction - (basic syntax, some important libraries)
  - linear regression, gradient descent
- Computer Vision
  - introduction to CNNs, implementing and understanding a simple convolutional nueral network.
  - residual networks (ResNets), image segmentation (U-Nets), object detection (YOLO, etc)
- Natural Language Processing
  - representation methods for text, sequential models - (RNN, LSTM), sentiment analysis (sentence classification)
  - language translation (seq-to-seq models), what is attention, implementing attention for seq-to-seq models, transformers (maybe?)  
- Generative Adversarial Networks
  - introduction to GANs (why and how?), simple generative model for mnist/cifar  
- Reinforcement Learning
  - introduction to RL, q-learning, implementing a simple q-learning proceedure for a custom env
  - deep q-learning, RL agent for a visdoom (shooting game)

**Pre-requisites**: There are **NONE** at all. However, do expect a big learning curve as we are trying to cover a lot of things at a decent pace. Don't worry we are starting right from the beginning.
